# ErgoDox EZ YamiFrankc's configuration

This is my QMK configuration for the Ergodox, its nowhere complete.
I still need to find many improvements, right now its not optimized for anything.
But I want to make it optimized for me, and coding when I learn more programming.

It has a couple diferences with the default keymap, however:

* Changed many of the thumbcluster keystroke
* Added ñ, 「 and 」
* Changed the symbols layer a bit

## TODO::
 * Better list of changes
 * Edit the images to refclect changes
 * RGB
